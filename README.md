## go-redirect-agent

Small go agent binary for running on a system to redirect http://go/ links to a secure URL.

By default, the agent will listen on `127.0.103.111`. It will not
listen on the IPv6 loopback interface as you might want to run other programs on port 80.

## Install

Use the install\_unix.sh or install\_windows.bat file to add the hosts entry.
